This project was especially near and dear, as this wedding was none other than my own. Set to take place in Fall 2018, we began concepting the look and feel of our wedding well over a year before the festivities were to take place. Since we were living in the San Francisco Bay Area at the time we knew we wanted to incorporate elements of the wild, natural beauty found on our back doorstep while maintaining a 'classic' look and feel.

For the wedding we created a series of print assets that carried these themes through, including a save-the-date, an invitation, ceremony programs, table markers, food and drink menus. Throughout each of the assets we were able to keep a consistent, classic look and feel and were able to add touches of our new California home throughout. In the save the date, we featured a photo of my fiancée, myself, and our dog visiting beautiful Lake Tahoe. For each of the table cards we added a customized map of significant locations in our lives, throughout our new home in California and our childhood homes in Northeast Ohio.

To complete the pre-wedding experience, we developed a custom website for our wedding featuring details of the ceremony, reception, wedding party and more. Guests were able to find links to our registries, hotel accommodations, and submit their RSVPs directly via the site – no hassle of heading back to the mailbox!

The project was a total success – countless guests commented on the ease of the site and the attention to detail woven throughout the experience both online and offline.
