Mbody Health Ltd. is a massage therapy practice started by Dr. Paula Qualls-Mitchell in 2006. Based in Akron, Ohio, Mbody Health has served its clients by providing a wide array of high quality massage services, ranging from relaxation massages to medical massages.

Motivated to grow her practice, Dr. Qualls-Mitchell came to Eponym Design to develop a website that could help her reach new customers. Some years ago she'd started to develop a website on her own using Wix, but found the tools were difficult to use and tedious to maintain. Fortunately, that experience had not only revealed the value of a partner in building an online presence, but helped define the content needed for the site.

Working from Dr. Qualls-Mitchell's already existing content, Eponym was able to quickly develop a brand new site that took advantage of the latest technologies, resulting in a site that was not only functional and attractive, but highly performant. The site provides customers with information about the practice and its history, the staff, the services offered, pricing, payment options, insurance coverage, allows customers to submit appointment requests, and allows customers to send general questions to the staff.
