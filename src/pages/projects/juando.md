Jack H (AKA Juando) is an Austin, Texas based DJ and producer, specializing in all things house music. Despite years of experience creating and playing house music under the alias Juando, he realized he'd never created a visual identity for his on-stage persona. Determined to create a brand that fit this persona, Jack turned to Eponym to craft an identity.

From the onset, Jack knew he wanted a logo that was both modern and minimalistic – representative of both the style of music he produces in the studio, and plays live. With this guidance, we went through a series of logo iterations and ultimately landed on one that fit the style Jack was aiming for. Through its use of angular lettering and negative space the design is both visually minimal, and avant garde.

The result was outstanding. Jack was pleased to finally have a logo that not only represented his unique talent, but also helped fans recognize his work both online and at shows by presenting it under one consistent visual identity.
