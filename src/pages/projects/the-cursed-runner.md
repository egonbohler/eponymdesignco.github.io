Pleased with Eponym's work on the logo for Juando, Jack H returned to us with another logo design project – this time for his side project The Cursed Runner. Started in 2018 as an indie group, The Cursed Runner has been producing music and steadily releasing new tracks on BandCamp while residing in their hometown of Austin, TX. To add a professional touch to their online presence, Jack H turned to Eponym to once again create a brand that suited their needs.

Inspired by movies such as Donnie Darko and Requiem for a Dream, Jack wanted a graphic that spoke to the name's dark side – something that would read as spooky without being cartoonish. After several iterations, we landed on something that fit the bill – a modified form of the Trajan font face.

With the logo complete, the team turned to creating a set of social media assets that could be used across BandCamp and other platforms. To round out the dark theme, we used background imagery that evoked a feeling of being 'cursed' – think dark roads, empty spaces, and lots of fog.
