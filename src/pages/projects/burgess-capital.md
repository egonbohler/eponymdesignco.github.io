Burgess Capital is a small investment advisory firm run by a father & son duo out of their hometown of Coral Gables, Florida. With their years of experience in the industry, they decided it was time to split out a shop of their own and turned to Eponym Design to develop a brand identity that could not only catch the eye, but also build trust with both prospective and existing clientele.

As we do with all clients, we began concepting a new brand identity with 10 rapid-fire sketches and narrowing down to the 3 most diverse and compelling candidates. The three candidate concepts borrowed inspiration not only from the financial services sector, but also some of the most well-known brands in high fashion and technology. The result was a range of concepts varying in look and feel, from very traditional to ultra-modern; a process designed to narrow in on a direction forward by weeding out any obvious dead ends. After close review and discussion, the team decided to move forward with a more traditional design that evoked the upscale appeal of high fashion – a look that is not only aspirational for all clientele, but also appropriate for a business managing personal wealth. The result was a striking new mark that could be used with or without logotype, across a wide variety of media.

 With their new brand in place, Burgess Capital is focused on ramping up their operations and continue to grow their clientele.
