{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Pleased with Eponym's work on the logo for Juando, Jack H returned to us with another logo design project – this time for his side project The Cursed Runner. Started in 2018 as an indie group, The Cursed Runner has been producing music and steadily releasing new tracks on BandCamp while residing in their hometown of Austin, TX. To add a professional touch to their online presence, Jack H turned to Eponym to once again create a brand that suited their needs.</p>\n<p>Inspired by movies such as Donnie Darko and Requiem for a Dream, Jack wanted a graphic that spoke to the name's dark side – something that could read as macabre without being gauche.

With this guidance, we went through a series of logo iterations and ultimately landed on one that fit the style Jack was aiming for. Through its use of angular lettering and negative space the design is both visually minimal, and avant garde.</p>\n<p>The result was outstanding. Jack was pleased to finally have a logo that not only represented his unique talent, but also helped fans recognize his work both online and at shows by presenting it under one consistent visual identity.</p>","id":"4fe5ac84-3edd-5e2c-ab36-11e26adbaab3","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-09-10","path":"/projects/juando/","title":"Juando"}},"next":{"html":"<p>When deciding to run for a seat on the Akron city council Shammas Malik, an Akron native and graduate of Harvard law, knew his grassroots campaign would need to be effective not only on the ground, but also in print and digital media. Looking for help designing print pieces for a letter-writing campaign, the Malik for Akron campaign turned to Eponym Design.</p>\n<p>The goal of the letter-writing campaign seemed to be simple enough – use the influence of those who already supported Shammas's campaign by giving them a structured way to engage their circles in a conversation. In practice though, there were several competing priorities to account for in the final design. We needed to consider how to balance the need for a personalized message from sender to recipient, the campaign's branding and imagery, endorsements, and a primary call to action for the recipient to vote on election day.</p>\n<p>After several rounds of iteration, the team came to a design that seemed to nicely balance these priorities. The result was an envelope insert card, with a front dedicated to branding and imagery and leaving the flip-side for personalization, endorsements, and a call to action.</p>\n<p>The results were outstanding – letter-writing parties were held over the course of several weeks throughout the campaign, leading to hundreds of personalized messages rippling outward through the community. Pleased with the results of the letter-writing campaign, the Malik for Akron team engaged Eponym Design to develop a number of social media and print assets to broadcast the news of the numerous endorsements Shammas earned over the course of the campaign. The print designs were ultimately run in both the \"West Side Leader\" and \"The Reporter\" newspapers, circulating throughout the Greater Akron area.</p>\n<p>The Malik for Akron campaign was ultimately successful, winning the Democratic primary for Akron City Council Ward 8 with 81% of votes.</p>","id":"ee11c8e0-f83a-580d-bdab-506a8fa3bc3c","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-04-25","path":"/projects/malik-for-akron/","title":"Malik for Akron"}}}}
