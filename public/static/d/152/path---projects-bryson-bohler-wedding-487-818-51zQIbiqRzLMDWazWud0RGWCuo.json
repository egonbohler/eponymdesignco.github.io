{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This project was especially near and dear, as this wedding was none other than my own. Set to take place in August of 2018, we began concepting the look and feel of our wedding well over a year before the festivities were to take place. Since we were living in the San Francisco Bay Area at the time we knew we wanted to incorporate elements of the wild, natural beauty found on our back doorstep while maintaining a 'classic' look and feel.</p>\n<p>For the wedding we created a series of print assets that carried these themes through, including a save-the-date, an invitation, ceremony programs, table markers, food and drink menus.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Bohler Wedding","date":"2018-05-04","tags":["print

Determined to create a brand that fit this persona, Jack turned to Eponym to craft an identity.</p>\n<p>From the onset, Jack knew he wanted a logo that was both modern and minimalistic – representative of both the style of music he produces in the studio, and plays live. With this guidance, we went through a series of logo iterations and ultimately landed on one that fit the style Jack was aiming for. Through its use of angular lettering and negative space the design is both visually minimal, and avant garde.</p>\n<p>The result was outstanding. Jack was pleased to finally have a logo that not only represented his unique talent, but also helped fans recognize his work both online and at shows by presenting it under one consistent visual identity.</p>","id":"4fe5ac84-3edd-5e2c-ab36-11e26adbaab3","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-09-10","path":"/projects/juando/","title":"Juando"}}}}
