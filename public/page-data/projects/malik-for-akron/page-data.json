Looking for help designing print pieces for a letter-writing campaign, the Malik for Akron campaign turned to Eponym Design.</p>\n<p>The goal of the letter-writing campaign seemed to be simple enough – use the influence of those who already supported Shammas's campaign by giving them a structured way to engage their circles in a conversation. In practice though, there were several competing priorities to account for in the final design. We needed to consider how to balance the need for a personalized message from sender to recipient, the campaign's branding and imagery, endorsements, and a primary call to action for the recipient to vote on election day.</p>\n<p>After several rounds of iteration, the team came to a design that seemed to nicely balance these priorities. The result was an envelope insert card, with a front dedicated to branding and imagery and leaving the flip-side for personalization, endorsements, and a call to action.</p>\n<p>The results were outstanding – letter-writing parties were held over the course of several weeks throughout the campaign, leading to hundreds of personalized messages rippling outward through the community. Pleased with the results of the letter-writing campaign, the Malik for Akron team engaged Eponym Design to develop a number of social media and print assets to broadcast the news of the numerous endorsements Shammas earned over the course of the campaign. The print designs were ultimately run in both the \"West Side Leader\" and \"The Reporter\" newspapers, circulating throughout the Greater Akron area.</p>\n<p>The Malik for Akron campaign was ultimately successful, winning the Democratic primary for Akron City Council Ward 8 with 81% of votes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Malik for Akron","date":"2019-04-25","tags":["print

time for his side project The Cursed Runner. Started in 2018 as an indie group, The Cursed Runner has been producing music and steadily releasing new tracks on BandCamp while residing in their hometown of Austin, TX. To add a professional touch to their online presence, Jack H turned to Eponym to once again create a brand that suited their needs.</p>\n<p>Inspired by movies such as Donnie Darko and Requiem for a Dream, Jack wanted a graphic that spoke to the name's dark side – something that would read as spooky without being cartoonish. After several iterations, we landed on something that fit the bill – a modified form of the Trajan font face.</p>\n<p>With the logo complete, the team turned to creating a set of social media assets that could be used across BandCamp and other platforms. To round out the dark theme, we used background imagery that evoked a feeling of being 'cursed' – think dark roads, empty spaces, and lots of fog.  </p>\n<p>To check out The Cursed Runner, head over to <a href=\"https://thecursedrunner.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BandCamp.</a></p>","id":"f1f88299-f694-552f-95bf-ce967b78a0eb","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-28","path":"/projects/the-cursed-runner/","title":"The Cursed Runner"}},"next":{"html":"<p>Burgess Capital is a small investment advisory firm run by a father &#x26; son duo out of their hometown of Coral Gables, Florida. With their years of experience in the industry, they decided it was time to split out a shop of their own and turned to Eponym Design to develop a brand identity that could not only catch the eye, but also build trust with both prospective and existing clientele.</p>\n<p>As we do with all clients, we began concepting a new brand identity with 10 rapid-fire sketches and narrowing down to the 3 most diverse and compelling candidates. The three candidate concepts borrowed inspiration not only from the financial services sector, but also some of the most well-known brands in high fashion and technology. The result was a range of concepts varying in look and feel, from very traditional to ultra-modern; a process designed to narrow in on a direction forward by weeding out any obvious dead ends. After close review and discussion, the team decided to move forward with a more traditional design that evoked the upscale appeal of high fashion – a look that is not only aspirational for all clientele, but also appropriate for a business managing personal wealth. The result was a striking new mark that could be used with or without logotype, across a wide variety of media.</p>\n<p> With their new brand in place, Burgess Capital is focused on ramping up their operations and continue to grow their clientele.</p>","id":"d0091ea3-ce23-5156-a6ca-705f7a0151dc","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-06-13","path":"/projects/burgess-capital","title":"Burgess Capital"}}}}}
